            <p>Health in Perspective is a health policy journalism portfolio (hosted on the Beehiiv platform) that explores the intersection between public health and government policy. By detailing how health policy affects stakeholders and communities, I hope to investigate different means of improving access to and quality of care.</p>

            <h2>Journal Publications</h2>
            <p> Health in Perspective articles are posted weekly and cover a wide variety of health policy related issues and case studies. Below are a few topics covered by my previous articles:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Is Health a Priority? Shifting Priorities and "Health Scares" on College Campuses.</li>
                <li>Who Controls Health? A Complex Care System Network: Health Economics of Dialysis Treatment in India.</li>         
                <li>Case Study. Policy Determines Health Outcomes: The Flint Michigan Water Crisis.</li>                
                <li>Bridging the Gap. The Oregon Health Plan: A Healthcare Access Experiment.</li>
                <li>Quality vs Quantity? Maximizing Care: Rural Hospital Closures and Physician Shortage.</li>
            </ul>

                <p><span style="display: inline-block;">Over the past several weeks, I have focused more on increasing viewership and keeping my journal content interesting for my changing audience-base. By aggregating viewership data using variables including pageviews, theme, date & time, and open percent, I am working to identify what themes are most interesting to my audience-base and what articles I should focus on building moving forward.
                By honing in on 10 specific themes (argumentation, environment, North Carolina, Government Programs, Social Determinants of Health, Healthcare Access, International Policy, Case Studies, Education, and Infectious Disease) and by sorting through the times at which I publish my articles, I have developed strategies to build the Health in Perspective community and continually engage readers with new interesting articles.
