            <h1>Health in Perspective</h1>
            <p>Health in Perspective is a health policy journalism portfolio (hosted on the Beehiiv platform) that explores the intersection between public health and government policy. By detailing how health policy affects stakeholders and communities, I hope to investigate different means of improving access to and quality of care.</p>

            <h2>Journal Publications</h2>
            <p> Health in Perspective articles cover a wide variety of health policy related issues and case studies. Below are a few topics covered by my previous articles:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Who Controls Health? A Complex Care System Network: Health Economics of Dialysis Treatment in India.</li>         
                <li>Case Study. Policy Determines Health Outcomes: The Flint Michigan Water Crisis.</li>                
                <li>Bridging the Gap. The Oregon Health Plan: A Healthcare Access Experiment.</li>
                <li>Quality vs Quantity? Maximizing Care: Rural Hospital Closures and Physician Shortage.</li>
            </ul>
            <hr>
            <h2> Themes:</h2>
                <p>I am always looking for new ways to expand my audience! 
                   Over the past several months, I have focused my articles around 10 specific themes (argumentation and framing, environmental conservation, North Carolina-specific issues, Government Programs, Social Determinants of Health, Healthcare Access, International Policy, Public Health Case Studies, Education-Related News, and Infectious Disease).</p>
                <p> In the future, I hope to expand these articles as I learn more about health policy and become more involved in the field of public health.
