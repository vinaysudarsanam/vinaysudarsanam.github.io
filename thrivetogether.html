            <h1> Thrive Together </h1>
            <p>Thrive Together is a nonprofit organization developed in partnership by UNC Chapel Hill and Duke University students dedicated to reducing adverse childhood experiences among North Carolina children by reducing social and health inequities. among children in North Carolina. </p>
            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>At Thrive Together, our mission is to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Improve the well-being and quality of life for children in North Carolina</li>
                <li>Bridge the gaps between communities through targeted interventions</li>
                <li>Provide resources and support to underserved communities</li>
                <li>Advocate for policies that promote health and well-being while reducing disparities through research</li>
            </ul>
            <hr>
            <h2> Our Story:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>After arriving in North Carolina and exploring the Research Triangle Park, I recognized that while many regions in North Carolina are well off, many communities are underfunded and lack access to essential resources and opportunities.</li>
                <li>I partnered with my colleague at Duke University and created Thrive Together (established November 2022) to bridge the gap between communities in North Carolina. Our initial goal was to improve child and family health by providing evidence-based home visiting services to local communities. After months of planning, we set up an Advisory Panel and Board Team in 2023 and working with our new Board Members, we created the Community Support Initiative which started in March 2023.</li>
                <li>Ultimately, we realized that home visiting would be too time and resource-intensive for our new organization, and we decided to pivot away from home visiting in June 2023. As we move forward, we hope to design new initiatives to support local communities and reduce structural barriers that affect quality of life, specifically amongst infants and adolescents.</li>
            </ul>
            <hr>
              
            <h2>Our Initiatives</h2>
            <p>Our goal is to connect college students to local communities. At Thrive Together, we provide members with the ability to develop their own initiatives:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Community Support Initiative (CSI):</strong> Our main program that connects Thrive Together members with underrepresented communities in North Carolina. Through this initiative, we work directly with community members to identify pressing issues, provide resources, and develop sustainable solutions.</li>
                <li><strong>Outreach Plan:</strong> We collaborate with local communities and organizations to address needs and resolve structural disparities. By organizing events and raising awareness of our mission, we hope to reach more communities and create greater impact.</li>
            </ul>
