            <h1> Thrive Together </h1>
            <p>Thrive Together is an organization developed in partnership by UNC Chapel Hill and Duke University students dedicated to reducing adverse childhood experiences among North Carolina children by reducing social and health inequities.  </p>
            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>At Thrive Together, our mission is to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Improve the well-being and quality of life for children in North Carolina</li>
                <li>Bridge the gaps between communities through targeted interventions</li>
                <li>Provide resources and support to underserved communities</li>
                <li>Advocate for policies that promote health and well-being </li>
            </ul>

            <h2> Our Story:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>After arriving in North Carolina and exploring the Research Triangle Park, I recognized that many communities lack access to resources and opportunities.</li>
                <li>I partnered with a student at Duke University and created Thrive Together (established November 2022) to bridge the gap between communities in North Carolina. Our initial goal was to improve child and family health by providing evidence-based home visiting services to local communities. After months of planning, we set up an Advisory Panel and Board Team in 2023 and working with our new Board Members, we created the Community Support Initiative which started in March 2023.</li>
                <li>Ultimately, we decided to pivot from home visiting. As we move forward, we hope to design new initiatives to support local communities and reduce structural barriers that affect quality of life, specifically amongst infants and adolescents.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Our Initiatives</h2>
            <p>Our goal is to connect college students to local communities. We are always looking for new ways to help out!</p>
