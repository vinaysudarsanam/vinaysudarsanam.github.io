                    University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. My main interests are global health equity and clinical medicine. I hope to reduce social and 
                    health inequities that affect healthcare globally, while providing a voice 
                    to underserved communities.
                    <br><br>
                    Through cutting-edge research and by working with local and national organizations, 
                    I hope to ensure that everyone receives the care and attention necessary to live a 
                    long, healthy life.

            <br>
            I aim to collaborate with public health practitioners, clinicians, and government officials
            to develop interventions that improve access to and quality of healthcare globally. I hope 
            to identify strategies to reduce cases of acute conditions and improve quality of care for 
            chronic conditions while taking into account local cultures and health systems.
            By improving communication between patients, providers, and policymakers and reducing inequities 
            in healthcare access and quality, I hope to improve the quality of life of individuals worldwide.
