                    <h2>I am an Honors Health Policy and Management (Intended) student at the 
                    University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I hope to reduce social and 
                    health inequities that affect healthcare globally, while providing a voice 
                    to underserved communities improving access to opportunities and resources.
                    <br><br>
                    Through cutting-edge research and by working with local and national organizations, 
                    I hope to ensure that everyone receives the care and knowledge necessary to live a 
                    long, healthy life. 
                    <br><br>
                    I aim to bring communities closer together by providing resources and valuable information, making a positive impact on health outcomes and reducing inequalities that affect quality of life. In the future, I hope to enter the medical school as a surgeon, working with policymakers to address community-level disparities while also providing quality care at a more individual level.
