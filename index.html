                    Through cutting-edge research and by working with local and national organizations, 
                    I hope to ensure that everyone receives the care and knowledge necessary to live a 
                    long, healthy life.

            <br>
            I aim to bring communities closer together by providing resources and 
            valuable information, making a positive impact on health outcomes and reducing
             inequalities that affect quality of life. In the future, I hope to enter medical 
             school as a surgeon, working with policymakers to address community-level 
             disparities while also providing quality care at a more individual level.</h2>
