                The mission of Thrive Together is to reduce adverse childhood experiences 
                  amongst children in North Carolina by reducing social and health inequities. 
                  We hope to bridge the gap between communities by providing resources and 
                  resolving pressing needs. </p>
                  Over the past few months, we have been building the Community Support Initiative to. 
                  provide Thrive Together members with a way to work directly with underrepresented 
                  communities in North Carolina, solving pressing issues.

                <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; color: black;">Student Researcher at the PRC Lab.</p>
                At the PRC (Prabir Roy-Chaudhury) Lab, I explore vascular access and novel strategies to improve dialysis treatment. 
                Using histomorphometry and 3D Imaging Techniques, I work to identify occlusion in arteriovenous fistulae samples 
                and calculate maximal and average stenosis. By collaborating with other labs at the UNC Kidney Center, our goal 
                is to improve the quality of life of renal failure patients.

                <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; color: black;">Health Policy Journalist.</p>
                <p>I post succinct, argumentative pieces about various health policy topics on my Beehiiv portfolio titled "Health 
                  in Perspective". In my journal, I explore how science research is manifested in health policy decisions 
                 and how those decisions affect different populations of people. </p>
                 Some of my previous topics include: Medicare for All, Education Policy in NC, the Flint Michigan Water Crisis, Dialysis Treatment in India,
                 and Physician Shortage.

                <p>Learn To Be is a national organization providing free personal tutoring services to 
                    underserved students in a variety of subjects. </p> As a tutor, I teach algebra, geometry, and physics to local students.
