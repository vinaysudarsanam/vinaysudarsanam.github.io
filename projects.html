                At the PRC (Prabir Roy-Chaudhury) Lab, I explore vascular access and novel strategies to improve dialysis treatment. 
                Using histomorphometry and 3D Imaging Techniques, I work to identify occlusion in arteriovenous fistulae samples 
                and calculate maximal and average stenosis. By collaborating with other labs at the UNC Kidney Center, our goal 
                is to improve the quality of life of renal failure patients.
