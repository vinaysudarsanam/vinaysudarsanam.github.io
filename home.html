          I am an Honors Health Policy and Management (Intended) student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I hope to reduce social and health inequities that affect healthcare globally, while providing a voice to underserved communities improving access to opportunities and resources. 
          <br><br>
          Through cutting-edge research and by working with local and national organizations, I hope to ensure that everyone receives the care and knowledge necessary to live a long, healthy life.
